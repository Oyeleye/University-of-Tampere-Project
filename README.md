Exercise 2.2 (Small 3/2 points)
You can do the exercise with JavaFX (and NetBeans), or with React/create-react-app and Material-UI. There are tool specific requirements mentioned below.

Build the following program:

The program consists of

A line of text
Menus with
An "about" option which opens in information dialog
An update text option which changes the line of text to some other text (the new text can be a fixed string, i.e, no need to for user input in this exercise)
An example wireframe of how the application could be like:
wireframe for exercise 2.2

With JavaFX, define the interface in a FXML file.

In React/Material-UI, the menu should be in <AppBar> and display the text with <Typography>.

First deadline is 19.3. 12.00, final deadline is 24.3. 23:59



Exercise 2.3 (Small 3/2 points)
You can do the exercise with JavaFX (and NetBeans), or with React/create-react-app and Material-UI. 

Build the following program:

The program consists of

A line of text
Menus with
An update text option which opens a dialog where the user can type in text that will appear in the interface.
An example wireframe of how the application could be like:
wireframe for exercise 2.3.

JavaFX program should have mnemonics and accelerator keys for (some of the) menu options. In React/Material-UI solution you should utilise "makeStyles" for relevant parts of the interface (what are those is up to you).

First deadline is 19.3. 12.00, final deadline is 24.3. 23:59



Exercise 3.1 (Small 3/2 points)
You can do the exercise with JavaFX (and NetBeans), or with React/create-react-app and Material-UI.

Build the following program:

The program consists of three vertical sliders.

Moving the sliders control red, green and blue elements of the background of the area where the sliders are. 

An example wireframe of how the application could be like:

First deadline is 26.3. 12.00, final deadline is 31.3. 23:59


<Strong> Exercise 3.2 (Small 3/2 points) </Strong>
This exercise has slightly different reguirements for with JavaFX  and React/create-react-app and Material-UI.

With JavaFX, build the following program:

The is a list and a button. Clicking the button opens file chooser where user can select multiple files. Then the list displays names and file sizes (file object has method length() which tells file size in bytes).

With React build a page which consists of material-ui list. The list items consist of date as text and a date selector a text field. There are two buttons, one adds a new line and another removes a list. The date selector on each line updates the date in that line user can select elements in the list and the selected line is removed.
